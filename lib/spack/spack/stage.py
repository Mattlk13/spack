class Stage(object):
    """Manages a temporary stage directory for building.

    A Stage object is a context manager that handles a directory where
    some source code is downloaded and built before being installed.
    It handles fetching the source code, either as an archive to be
    expanded or by checking it out of a repository.  A stage's
    lifecycle looks like this::

        with Stage() as stage:      # Context manager creates and destroys the
                                    # stage directory
            stage.fetch()           # Fetch a source archive into the stage.
            stage.expand_archive()  # Expand the source archive.
            <install>               # Build and install the archive.
                                    # (handled by user of Stage)

    When used as a context manager, the stage is automatically
    destroyed if no exception is raised by the context. If an
    excpetion is raised, the stage is left in the filesystem and NOT
    destroyed, for potential reuse later.

    You can also use the stage's create/destroy functions manually,
    like this::

        stage = Stage()
        try:
            stage.create()          # Explicitly create the stage directory.
            stage.fetch()           # Fetch a source archive into the stage.
            stage.expand_archive()  # Expand the source archive.
            <install>               # Build and install the archive.
                                    # (handled by user of Stage)
        finally:
            stage.destroy()         # Explicitly destroy the stage directory.

    If spack.use_tmp_stage is True, spack will attempt to create
    stages in a tmp directory.  Otherwise, stages are created directly
    in spack.stage_path.

    There are two kinds of stages: named and unnamed.  Named stages
    can persist between runs of spack, e.g. if you fetched a tarball
    but didn't finish building it, you won't have to fetch it again.

    Unnamed stages are created using standard mkdtemp mechanisms or
    similar, and are intended to persist for only one run of spack.
